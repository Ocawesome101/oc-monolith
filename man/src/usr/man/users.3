[97mDESCRIPTION

[97mMETHODS
        getname[37m([97muid[37m:[93mnumber[37m): [91mstring[37m
                Resolves the provided [93muid[37m to a username.  If no corresponding username is found, returns a string in the form [91mUID: [97m<uid>[91m[37m.

        [97mlogin[37m([97muser[37m:[91mstring[37m or [93mnumber[37m, [97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m): [95mboolean[37m[, [91mstring[37m]
                Identical to [97musers[37m([97m2[37m).[97mlogin[37m, except that this function sets environment variables appropriately and accepts a username or UID as its first argument.

        [97mlogout[37m(): [95mboolean[37m
                Logs out the current user.

        [97muid[37m(): [93mnumber[37m
                Returns the current thread's login UID.  A UID of [93m-1[37m means the current thread is not logged in as a user and has no privileges.

        [97madd[37m([97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mcansudo[37m:[95mboolean[37m): [93mnumber[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Identical to its [97musers[37m([97m2[37m) counterpart, but takes a name rather than a UID.

        [97mdel[37m([97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m or [93mnumber[37m): ...
                Identical to [97musers[37m([97m2[37m).[97mdel[37m, but can take a string as its [91mname[37m argument.

        [97msetShell[37m([97mfile[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Sets the current user's login shell to [91mfile[37m.

                Returns the current user's login shell.  Alias for [94mos.getenv[37m([91m"SHELL"[37m).
