[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        In the beginning [91mSangar[37m wrote [93mOpenOS[37m, and it was stable, and it had features, and there was little fun.  And [93mOpenOS[37m was rewritten by [91mPayonel[37m, and it had more features, and it was more stable, and there was slightly more fun.

        Then there was [93mOpen Kernel[37m, and it had no features, and it was stable, and there was much rejoicing.

        And behold, then there came a new operating system called [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m, and it had features, and it was stable, and there was more rejoicing.  And [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m thought to itself, [97mwhat do the people want?[37m, and the people wanted [92mconfig[37m, and [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m added [92mconfig[37m, and there was still more rejoicing.  And [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m supported [92mconfig[37m, and [93mOpen Kernel[37m did not support [92mconfig[37m, and thus came OS-dependence and to [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m the [91mDeveloper[37m sent features, but to [93mOpen Kernel[37m he sent not features.  And there was some confusion.

        And the people said, let us make fun of the [91mDeveloper[37m and refer to [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m as "an unstable poorly-debugged mess" (which it was), and the [91mDeveloper[37m was angry.  And so the [91mDeveloper[37m made a new OS, which he called [93mProton[37m, and Proton was the name of a Steam extension, and there was confusion, and [93mPhoton[37m became known as [93mPhoton[37m. And [93mPhoton[37m supported [92mconfig[37m, but did not support anything else, and the [91mDeveloper[37m was happy, but the people were confused.

        And [91mPayonel[37m sold [93mOpenOS[37m with OpenComputers, and it was better than Photon, and the fiftieth OS war raged upon the land.  And behold, [93mPhoton[37m was killed, and there was much rejoicing from [91mPayonel[37m.  But the [91mDeveloper[37m wrote a new operating system, and he called it [93mMonolith[37m, and [93mMonolith[37m was a new OS, and [93mMonolith[37m was good.

        And [93mMonolith[37m was good, and [93mPhoton[37m was not, and [93mMonolith[37m was given features and support, and [93mPhoton[37m and [93mOpen Kernel 2[37m and [93mOpen Kernel[37m were not.  And the OS world was a complete mess, and everyone wrote code for everyone else, and confusion abounded.
