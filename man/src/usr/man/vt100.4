        vt100 - interface with the terminal through text-based commands

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        The [97mVT100[37m terminal specification is a common method of interfacing with the terminal on UNIX-like systems.  It provides a simple yet powerful textual control scheme through the use of certain commands written to the terminal through, for example, [94mio.write[37m.

[97mCOMMANDS[37m
        Monolith's [97mVT100[37m implementation provides the following escape codes.  Each is documented appropriately.

        [97m{ESC}[37m is used to reference the ASCII escape character, 0x1B.

        All numbers, unless otherwise specified, default to 1.  Return values are usually read through [94mio.read[37m.

                Move the cursor to row [93myy[37m, column [93mxx[37m.  Does not scroll or go off-screen.

        [91m{ESC}[[93mnn[91mJ[37m
                Clears portions of the screen.  [93mnn[37m defaults to 0.

                If [93mnn[37m is 0, clears the screen from the current cursor position to the bottom.

                If [93mnn[37m is 1, clears the screen from the top to the current cursor position.

                If [93mnn[37m is 2, clears the entire screen. Resets the cursor position to [97m1, 1[37m.

        [91m{ESC}[[93mnn[91mK[37m
                Clears portions of the current line.  [93mnn[37m defaults to 0.

                If [93mnn[37m is 0, clears the current line from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

                If [93mnn[37m is 1, clears the current line from the beginning of the line to the current cursor position.

                If [93mnn[37m is 2, clears the entire current line.

                Sets and unsets various terminal attributes such as text color.  Accepts multiple arguments per call.

                Each argument is interpreted individually.

                If the argument is in the range 30-37 or 90-97, sets the text foreground color.  See [97mCOLORS[37m below.

                If the argument is in the range 40-47 or 100-107, sets the text background color.  See [97mCOLORS[37m below.

                If the argument is 0, resets all attributes - echo, foreground, and background.

                If the argument is 7 or 27, switches the foreground and background colors.

                If the argument is 8, disables text echo.

                If the argument is 28, enables text echo.

                If [93mnn[37m is 6, returns the current cursor position as [91m{ESC}[[93myy;xx[91mR[37m.

                If [93mnn[37m is 5, returns [91m{ESC}[[93m0[91mn[37m if the terminal's GPU is bound to a screen and [91m{ESC}[[93m3[91mn[37m if it is not.

        Monolith's VT100 emulator supports both standard and "bright" colors.  Standard colors are accessed in the ranges 30-37 (foreground) and 40-47 (background), and bright colors are accessed by adding 60 to the color value.  Colors can be configured through [93m/etc/vtcolors.cfg[37m.

        Color codes, their names, and their default hexvalues follow.
