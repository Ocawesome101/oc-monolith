[97mNAME[37m
        install - install files from one directory to another

[97mSYNOPSIS
        install --help
        install[37m [[97m--from[37m=][95mfrom[37m [[97m--to[37m=[[95mto[37m

[97mDESCRIPTION
        install[37m is a program that primarily serves as a compatibility program between Monolith and OpenOS.  At its most basic level, [97minstall[37m simply copies files from [95mfrom[37m to [95mto[37m.

        [97minstall[37m will search for a [92m.install[37m file on the source media.  If found, [97minstall[37m will execute it with an [93minstall[37m table in its global environment containing fields [93mfrom[37m and [93mto[37m, similar to the OpenOS program.

        If [92m.install[37m is not found, [97minstall[37m will search for a [92m.prop[37m file on the source.  This file should contain a Lua table with the optional fields [93msetboot:boolean[37m, [93msetlabel:boolean[37m, [93mlabel:string[37m, and [93mreboot:boolean[37m.

[97mEXAMPLES
        install [95m/[37m [95m/mnt/0b2[37m
                 Installs all files except [92m.prop[37m from [95m/[37m to the filesystem mounted at [95m/mnt/0b2[37m.

        [97minstall --from[37m=[95m/ [97m--to[37m=[95m/mnt/0b2[37m
                 Performs exactly the same action as the above example.

[97mNOTES
        install[37m has only loosely been tested, but appears to work to the extent expected. Please report bugs at [94mhttps://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-monolith/issues[37m.
