*NAME&
        vled - the Visual Lua EDitor

*SYNOPSIS
        vled& [*-s&|*--syntax&|*--highlight&] [?file&]
        *vled& *--syntax&=?lang& [?file&]

*DESCRIPTION
        vled& is the successor to *ed&(*1&), *led&&(*1&), and *fled&(*1&).  It provides a visual interface similar to both *fled& and the standard UNIX editor #vi&.

        *vled& features several improvements over its predecessors.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of new or improved features over *fled&.

            - Rudimentary and very experimental support for syntax highlighting;
            - Use of the *editor&(*3&) library, rather than defining its own buffer management utilities. This allows for persistent state across launches, as well as allowing other programs to access and modify open buffers;
            - Proper arrow-key navigation support;
            - Support for using the ^[TAB]& key to switch between 'command' mode and 'visual' mode;
            - Proper support for scrolling when the cursor goes offscreen, and when entering visual mode the cursor will be moved within the screen;

        as well as others.

        If the command-line flag *--syntax&, *-s&, or *--highlight& are specified, *vled& attempts to find a syntax highlighter for the file's extension.  IF *--syntax& is given a value and no other highlighting is found, attempts to load the specified highlighting.

        Unlike *ed&, *led& and *fled&, *vled& will automatically create a buffer if there is no existing buffer for the specified file, or if the specified file is not found.

        vled& supports several common commands, all of which are almost direct clones of their #vi& equivalents.  Commands must be prefixed with the *:& character.

        *w& [?filename&]
                Write the current buffer.  If ?filename& is specified, writes to ?filename& instead of the buffer's name.

        *q&
                Exit *vled&.  Does not close or remove buffers.

        *wq&
                Exit *vled&, writing the current buffer and closing it.

        *cq&
                Exit *vled&, closing (but ~NOT SAVING&) the current buffer.

        *d&[?n&]
                Delete the current line, or ?n& lines, starting at the cursor position and extending down.

        *[%]s/?expr*/?string*/&
                Substitute all matches for the Lua pattern ?expr& with ?string&.  If *%& is present, operate on the whole buffer instead of the current line.
        
        #linenum&
                Jump the cursor to line #linenum&.
