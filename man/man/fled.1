*NAME&
        FLED - Fullscreen Lua EDitor

*SYNOPSIS
        fled

        fled& ?file&

*DESCRIPTION
        fled& is the default text editor of the Monolith system, superseding *ed&(*1&) and superseded by *vled&(*1&).  *fled& is a visual text editor inspired by the real-world editor #vim& while also remaining similar to *ed&.  Perhaps the most appealing attribute of *fled& is its ability to easily switch between multiple loaded buffers in just a few keystrokes.

        Upon launching *fled&, you will be presented with a black screen, with a red ~:& prompt in the bottom left-hand corner, similar to *less&(*1&).  This prompt will accept certain commands, listed here.  Note that the short form is usually preferred.

        Options mandatory for long commands are mandatory for short commands too.

        *h&, *help&
                Redirect to this manual page.

        *o&, *open& ?file&
                Open and load file ?file& from the filesystem into a buffer.  ?file& must exist in the filesystem.

        *n&, *new& [?name&]
                Create a new, empty buffer, optionally assigning its name as ?name&.  If ?name& is not specified, the user will be prompted on saving the buffer.

        *w&, *save& [?file&]
                Save the currently selected buffer to ?file& or, if ?file& is not specified, to the buffer's name.  Failing this, the user will be prompted for a filename.
        *b& ?buffer&
                Set the current buffer to ?buffer&.

        *bl&
                Prints a list of all currently loaded buffers, in the format "~id.& #name".

        *db& ?buffer&
                Delete loaded buffer ?buffer&.

        *l&
                Prints the length (in lines) of the current buffer.

        *dl& [?line&]
                Removes ?line& from the current buffer.  ?line& defaults to 1.

        *i& [?line&]
                Enter insert mode at ?line&.  If ?line& is not specified, it will default to 1.

        *sc& [?line&]
                Scrolls the current buffer so that line ?line&, or line 1, is at the top of the screen.  Scroll is stored at runtime on a per-buffer basis, but is not saved externally.

        *q&
                Quit *FLED& without saving.  ~WARNING: This command will not save ANY buffers, nor does it prompt before exiting!&

        *wq&
                Saves all buffers, then quits *FLED&.
