                Kernel booted: *no&
                Init started: *no&
                Services started: *no&
                Multi-user mode: *no&

        *1&
                Kernel booted: *yes&
                Init started: *yes&
                Services started: *no&
                Multi-user mode: *no&

        *2&
                Kernel booted: *yes&
                Init started: *yes&
                Services started: *yes&
                Multi-user mode: *no&

        *3&
                Kernel booted: *yes&

                Services started: *yes&
                Multi-user mode: *yes&

*METHODS
        setrunlevel&(*n&:#number&): ?boolean& or *nil&, ~string&
                Attempt to set the system's runlevel.  Only root can do this.

        *getrunlevel&(): #number&
                Returns the system's current runlevel.

*CONFIGURATION&
        The maximum runlevel is set through a flag in #/boot/kernel/loader& -- see *loader&(*5&).  If not specified, defaults to 3.
