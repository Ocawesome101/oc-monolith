*NAME&
        Monolith - the Monolith Operating System for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod

*DESCRIPTION
        Monolith& is an operating system, and collection of utilities for that operating system, written in Lua for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.  The name is a reference to both the large black box from *2001: A Space Odyssey& known as the Monolith and the fact that Monolith is a monolithic kernel.

        *Monolith& draws heavily from the design of the real-world #Linux& and #UNIX& operating systems.  It should be largely compatible with real-world Lua programs.  *Monolith& includes a selection of other APIs, some of which are defined by the OpenComputers wiki at ^https://ocdoc.cil.li&, such as @filesystem&, @event&, or @serializatioon&, and others which are defined solely from a utility perspective, such as @config& or @users&.

        On boot, the user will be presented with a login prompt.  If installing from Git, the default root credentials are ~root& and ~root&.

        *Monolith& features a mostly ANSI/VT100-compatible terminal, supporting many common, and some uncommon, escape codes.  The VT100 emulator supports bright colors through adding 60 to the color;  for example, ~\27[37m& (normal-white) would become ~\27[97m& (bright-white).  For additional information, see *vt100&(*4&)

*NOTES&
        When Monolith is installed through the OpenOS installer, a user account will be set up and the root password set.
