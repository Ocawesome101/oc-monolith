*NAME&
        install - install files from one directory to another

*SYNOPSIS
        install --help
        install& [*--from&=]?from& [*--to&=[?to&

*DESCRIPTION
        install& is a program that primarily serves as a compatibility program between Monolith and OpenOS.  At its most basic level, *install& simply copies files from ?from& to ?to&.

        *install& will search for a @.install& file on the source media.  If found, *install& will execute it with an #install& table in its global environment containing fields #from& and #to&, similar to the OpenOS program.

        If @.install& is not found, *install& will search for a @.prop& file on the source.  This file should contain a Lua table with the optional fields #setboot:boolean&, #setlabel:boolean&, #label:string&, and #reboot:boolean&.

*EXAMPLES
        install ?/& ?/mnt/0b2&
                 Installs all files except @.prop& from ?/& to the filesystem mounted at ?/mnt/0b2&.

        *install --from&=?/ *--to&=?/mnt/0b2&
                 Performs exactly the same action as the above example.

*NOTES
        install& has not yet been tested. Please report bugs at ^https://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-monolith/issues&.
