*NAME&
        package - reimplementation of the Lua standard package library

*DESCRIPTION
        package& is a partial re-implementation of the Lua-standard *package& library.

*METHODS
        searchpath&(*name&:~string&, *path&:~string&[, *sep&:~string&[, *rep&:~string&]]): ~string& or nil, @table&
                Used internally by ^require&.  Searches the provided ~path& for ~name&.  Replaces all instances of ~%& in the path with ~name&.

                ~path& is expected to be formatted as a series of entries separated by the ~;& character.

*GLOBALS&
        The *package& library defines the following globals.

        @package.loaded&
                A cache of all loaded libraries.

        ~package.path&
                The path to search for libraries.

        ^dofile&(*file&:~string&): ... or *nil&, ~string&
                Attempt to execute file ~file&.

        ^require&(*lib&:~string&[, *reload&:?boolean&]): ...
                Attempt to load library ~lib& from the package path.  If the library is already loaded *and& ?reload& is false or not specified, returns the cached library.  Othwewise, loads the library from disk.

                On failure, ^require& raises the error rather than returning it.
