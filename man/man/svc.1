*NAME&
        svc - manage background services

*SYNOPSIS
        svc ?list
        *svc enable ?service
        *svc disable ?service
        *svc start&|*stop ?service

*DESCRIPTION
        svc& is the default service management tool for the *InitMe&(*1&) init system shipped with Monolith.  It supports enabling and disabling of services, as well as starting and stopping.

*OPTIONS
        *enable ?service&
                Enables service ?service& to be started on boot.  Services are expected to run in the background and provide functions through IPC or other means, similar to event listeners.

        *disable ?service&
                Disables service ?service&.

        *start ?service&
                Starts the background service ?service&.

        *stop ?service&
                Stops the background service ?service&, if it is running.

*NOTES&
        [Until 2020.7.09]  Due to a limitation with the current InitMe configuration scheme, a script and a service cannot both have the same name and be simultaneously enabled.

        [2020.7.09]  This has been fixed.  Scripts are now run in order from #/lib/scripts&.

        [2020.8.03]  Scripts are now run from #/lib/init/scripts&.
