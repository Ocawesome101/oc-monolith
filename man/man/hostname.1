*DESCRIPTION
        hostname& is a simple command-line utility used to show or set the hostname of the Monolith system.

If ?name& is specified, but the current user does not have the proper permissions, *hostname& will throw an error. If ?name& is not specified, the system hostname will be printed to standard output.
