*NAME&
        buffer - implementation of Lua's FILE object

*DESCRIPTION&
        The *buffer& API is an implementation of the FILE object in PUC Lua 5.3 and above.  It is used primarily in the *io&(*3&) library, but can be used elsewhere as well.

*METHODS
        new&(*mode&:~string&, *stream&:@table&): @table&
            Returns a buffered interface to the provided @stream&.  Used directly in ^io.open&.

            The returned stream may be treated identically to Lua's FILE object.

*COPYRIGHT
        buffer& is copyright (c) 2013 ~Sangar& as part of OpenOS.
