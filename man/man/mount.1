*NAME&
        mount - mount a filesystem

*SYNOPSIS
        mount

        mount& [*-rwo&] ?device dir

        *mount& [*--rw&|*--ro&] ?device dir

*DESCRIPTION&
        All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at #/&. These files can be spread out over several devices. The *mmount& command serves to attach the filesystem found at some address to the big file tree. Conversely, the *umount& command will detach it again. The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device.

        The standard form of the *mount& command is:

                *mount& ?device dir&

        This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem whose address begins with *device& at the directory *dir&.
