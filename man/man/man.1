*NAME&
        man - an interface to the system reference manuals

*SYNOPSIS&
        *man& ?page
        *man& [@section&|--section=@<section>&] ?page

*DESCRIPTION&
        *man& is the system's manual pager.  The ?page& argument given to *man& is usually the name of a program, utility, or library.  The ?manual page& associated with this argument is then found and displayed.  A @section&, if provided, will direct *man& to look only in that @section& of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available @sections& following a pre-defined order (see *DEFAULTS&), and to show only the first ?page& found, even if ?page& exists in several @sections&.

        The table below shows the @section& numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

        1   Executable programs or shell commands
        2   System APIs (APIs provided by the kernel)
        3   User APIs (APIs provided by userspace)
        4   File formats and conventions, e.g. #/etc/passwd&
        5   Miscellaneous documentation

        A manual ?page& consists of several sections.

        Conventional section names include *NAME&, *SYNOPSIS&, *CONFIGURATION&, *DESCRIPTION&, *OPTIONS&, *RETURN VALUES&, *ERRORS&, *ENVIRONMENT&, *FILES&, *VERSIONS&, *NOTES&, *BUGS&, *EXAMPLE&, *AUTHORS&, and *SEE ALSO&.

        The following conventions apply to the *SYNOPSIS& section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

        *bold text&      type exactly as shown.
        ?magenta text&   replace with appropriate argument.
        [*-abc&]         any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
        *-a&|*-b&          options delimited by | cannot be used together.
        ?argument& ...   ?argument& is repeatable.

        Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render colored text when running in a monochrome terminal.

        The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.

*EXAMPLES
        man ?ls&
            Display the manual page for the @item& (program) ?ls&.

        *man @3 ?shell&
            Display the manual page for API ?shell& from section @3&.

*DEFAULTS&
        The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $*MANSECT&.  By default it is as follows:

                1 3 4 2 5

        The vt100-formatted manual page is displayed using a ~pager&.  The default pager is *less&(*1&).

*ENVIRONMENT&
        *MANPATH& or *MAN_PATH&
                if $*MANPATH& or $*MAN_PATH& is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

        *MANPAGER& or *MAN_PATER&
                if $*MANPAGER& or $*MAN_PAGER& is set, *man&(*1&) will attempt to load the specified file as its pager.

*FILES&
        #/usr/share/man&
                A global manual page hierarchy.
