*NAME&
        led - line editor

*SYNOPSIS
        led

DESCRIPTION&
        Before the introduction of the slightly more user-friendly *FLED&(*1&), the line editor *led&, or LuaEd, was the default editor for Monolith.  It is less advanced than *FLED&, but very similar in concept and design.  *ed& is inspired by PsychOS 2's #ced& and UNIX's #ed&.

        Available commands are listed below.
