*NAME&
        loader - Monolith boot loader

*DESCRIPTION&
        The default Monolith loader is found at #/boot/kernel/loader&.  It exists primarily to keep compatibility with the OpenLoader BIOS - otherwise, its provisions would be placed in #/init.lua&.

        *loader& provides the kernel logger and passes the kernel a table of flags.

*CONFIGURATION&
        The default loader script contains a table of flags starting on line 4.  The following flags are currently supported:

        *init&~string&
                The script to load and run as the init process.  Should only be changed when developing alternate init systems.

        *quiet&:?boolean&
                Whether to disable screen logging on boot.  May slightly improve boot times.

        *runlevel&:#number&
                The maximum runlevel the system should attempt to reach.  Values larger than 3 will have no effect.
